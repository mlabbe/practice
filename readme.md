# Practice #

A small program (or set of programs) I wrote for myself that varies daily practice in an organized way.

Nothing fancy about this code -- it just takes a practice matrix and flattens it into a linear [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) document that can be completed over time.

I made this source public because the idea of varying practice, or using an org-mode document may be novel, and useful as an example for others who may want to attempt similar.

The practice documents that these programs generate are bespoke, and probably not generally useful.
